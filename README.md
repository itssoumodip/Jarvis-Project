# Jarvis-Project
Jarvis is a Python-based personal assistant that uses speech recognition and text-to-speech to perform tasks via voice commands. It can open websites, play music, provide time-based greetings, and interact with Google's Gemini AI for dynamic conversations, making your digital experience more intuitive and efficient.
